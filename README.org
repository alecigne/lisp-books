- Chapter 3 :: Check it [[file:pcl/pcl3/pcl3.lisp][here]]. Note that the final solution is not the
  one of the book since I took the liberty to transform ~update~ into
  a macro. The result is... questionable :D Browse [[https://github.com/alecigne/lisp-books/blob/26e8734d9c73aa2067cca5e0dec640a62022cc8f/pcl3.lisp][this version]] for a
  solution that's closer to the book.
