Some of this code might depends on [[https://github.com/alecigne/cl-utils][cl-utils]], a personal collection of
Common Lisp utilities. Some projects might also depend from other
chapters. For example, [[file:agitsc/agitsc14/][agitsc14]] depends on the unit test framework
developed from scratch in [[file:pcl/pcl9/][pcl9]] ðŸ™‚
